How to install and run RIFEC
============================

The script has some dependencies, all of which should be easily
installable from CPAN or through your package manager.  See the
"Dependencies" section below for a list of which packages you need.

Once you have downloaded the tarball (or checked out the directory)
from github, all you need to do is edit the config file to tell it
about your cards, where you want your images to be saved, etc.  The
example config file "rifec.config" contains a commented example
configuration.

Run the script with a single "--help" parameter to get a short help
text on usage.

If run without the --config=FILE parameter, rifec.pl will look for a
config file named "rifec.config" in the current directory (the
directory you are located in when calling it - not the directory where
the script is located).

Dependencies
============

On Fedora 14, yum installing the following packages should be
sufficient to run the script:

perl-MooseX-Declare
perl-Config-IniFiles
perl-libwww-perl
perl-MD5
perl-Archive-Tar
perl-IO-stringy
perl-XML-Simple
perl-File-Sync
perl-Proc-Daemon

Un Ubuntu, apt-get installing the following packages should do the
trick:

libmoose-perl
libmoosex-declare-perl
libconfig-inifiles-perl
libwww-perl
libdigest-md5-perl
libarchive-tar-perl
libio-stringy-perl
libxml-simple-perl
libfile-sync-perl
libproc-daemon-perl
