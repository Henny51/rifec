# You can have multiple cards: They need to be in separate sections,
# since you may want to put the images coming from them into different
# directories.  Each section must be named "card FOO", where "FOO" can
# be pretty much anything you like.  If you want to treat them all the
# same, the Folder settings can be moved to the 'main' section
# instead.

# After setting the card up on Windows using the Eye-Fi software, find
# the config file called
# C:\Documents and Settings\<User>\Application Data\Eye-Fi\Settings.xml
# and open it.  In this file there is a number of <Card> elements, and
# in each of those blocks (if you have multiple cards) you will find
# the MacAddress and UploadKey elements which should be copied over to
# the card settings below.

# For help on the SubFolder format string, see:
#
# http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man3/strftime.3.html
#
# For testing the format string, you can run this on the command line:
#
# $ perl -MPOSIX -e 'print strftime("%Y-%m-%d", localtime()), "\n"'
#
# Where you replace %Y-%m-%d with the format string you want; if the
# result prints out the subdirectory name you want, you're good.
